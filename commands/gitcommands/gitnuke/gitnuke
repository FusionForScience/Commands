# The gitnuke script performs the following actions:
# - Generates a patch for your current work
# - Resets the local history to the commit before the one you want to nuke
# - Pushes to origin with the --force flag, overwriting its copy of the history
# - Leaves you to ponder your actions
# Please be aware that your patch will not automatically be committed. This is
# left to the user to decide.

# Verify that a commit message has been passed to this command.
# If no message has been passed, throw an error.
