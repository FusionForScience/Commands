# Commands

Some simple commands that I have created for my own personal use.

## CRLF
* If the commands in the repo fail to run, it may be a result of CRLF line endings on windows. 
    * The error message mentions something regarding '$\r' character.
* Please use dos2unix to convert all CRLF line endings.
* You can download dos2unix using the following command: "sudo apt install dos2unix".
* Following installation, run the following command: "dos2unix <file_name>".
* This will convert all CRLF line endings and allow you to run the script.
